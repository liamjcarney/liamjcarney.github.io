                <h2>About Liam Carney</h2>
                <p>
                    Liam Carney is a Canadian composer who is known for his unique approach to music. His style ranges from alternative pop to modern classical and contemporary music for film and video games. His work focuses on telling stories through music in new and exciting ways - this is expressed in his newest album “Interwoven Stories“.  Liam is influenced by a large variety of styles, however, each of his songs aims on focusing on raw emotion or feeling to best fit the scenes presented. He is experienced in collaborating with vocalists and instrumentalists, often recording with friends in his home studio or commissioning artists from across the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Liam was born and raised in Canada, for most of his childhood, he competed nationally as a figure skater, later composing and editing program music for peers. His exposure to music through skating was a driving force behind his passion and love of scoring music.
