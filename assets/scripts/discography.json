        "description": "This portfolio album showcases a dynamic blend of musical styles. I wanted to push my ability from writing big symphonic sections to cozy, intimate pieces that come together seamlessly. This album started production in 2022 and finished in 2023 and is incredibly special to me being my favorite collection of music that I’ve currently written.\n\nI worked with many of my close friends to bring this album to life, featuring numerous musicians and vocalists recorded at home or remotely. I also collaborated with mixing engineer Michael Yang and artist Alonso Urmeneta to bring this project together. I filmed and edited the music videos.\n\nThe first track, “Once Upon A Time” acts as the grand opening for the project, interweaving vocals performed by my friend Krystal Laplante and full symphonic statements using a virtual orchestra. The tracks, “Wind and Ruined Walkways” and “The Challengers” are video game-inspired pieces based on background and battle music respectively. Featuring cello performed by Polina Faustov. “A Moment With You” is a jazz track reminiscent of old jazz standards. “Afternoon On Weekends” is a waltz and “I Might Fly” is a cottagecore song with authentic performances from all my best friends.",

Despite the rushed work, many composers and developers at GDC 2023 commented positively on the music and sound design. I used WWise for audio integration.\n\nContact me for a download to play",

The film is tongue and cheek humor with a lot of charm.\n\nWe took inspiration from movies like Up, Kitbul, and Ratatouille for the soundtrack and SFX.
